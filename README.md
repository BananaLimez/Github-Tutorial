# Team GitHub Workflow

This is a **super simple guide** for our team to use GitHub together.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 1: First Upload (done by one person)
Run these commands in the project folder:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ðŸ“¥ Step 2: Teammates Download the Project
Each teammate runs this once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Step 3: Daily Workflow (Everyone)
When you want to work on something:

```bash
git pull origin main             # get latest code
git checkout -b feature-xyz      # make a branch for your task
# (edit files)
git add .                        
git commit -m "did something"    
git push origin feature-xyz      # send branch to GitHub
```

Then go to GitHub â†’ open a **Pull Request (PR)** â†’ get review â†’ merge into `main`.

---

## âœ… Rules
- Never push directly to `main`.  
- Always make a **branch** for your task.  
- Always **pull before starting work**.  
- Use clear commit messages.  
- Or just git push origin main :p

---

## Example Branch Names
- `feature/login-page`
- `bugfix/navbar-crash`
- `update/readme`
